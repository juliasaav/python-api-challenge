# python-api-challenge

#By Julia Saavedra

#This project consists of two parts (WeatherPy and VacationPy) that both interact with apis and work in conjunction with one another. Firstly, Openweathermap is used to select specific data on cities' weather conditions which are then used to generate scatter plots and their linear regressions. The second part uses the same city data frame and creates a visual map with points on the cities. From a more narrowed down version of the same data frame, geoapify's api is used to locate the closest hotel to the cities and another visual map is generated.
